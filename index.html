    <h1>The White Tiger</h1>

    <p class="coolfont"> I love white tigers because they are rare. It is a top predator which is at the apex of the food chain and keeps the
      population of wild ungulates in check, thereby maintaining the balance between prey herbivores and the vegetation upon
      which they feed. Therefore, the presence of tigers in the forest is an indicator of the well being of the ecosystem.</p>
